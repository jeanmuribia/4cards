Second ever challenge, i only started last week with html and CSS and this one was challenging but 
was really helpful to understand the difference between flex, grid and float. I challenged myself to used all of them in different 
positions and I think i did a pretty good job but i'm not quite sure about the responsive aspect of it though.
